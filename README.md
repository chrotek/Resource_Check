# resourcecheck.sh

Script to analyze resource consumption for a Linux device, using logs generated by sar 

#### Disclaimer / Bugs / Oversights
    
This script is still a work in progress.  **And still has bugs that I don't know when/if i'll get time to fix**

--- Memory Bug ---

There is a bug calculating memory usage, as the files it uses (sar) aren't always formatted exactly the same way.

If you run this and get any errors under memory, don't trust the information it's giving you.

You can avoid this error by only requesting today's logs ( replace `<options>` with `tl0` )

--- CPU Bug ---

There is also a bug calculating CPU cores. The script accounts for hyperthreading, but it doesn't account for multiple sockets.

Double check it's reporting the right amount of CPU cores in the output, if that's wrong, don't trust the CPU info


Bet i'm really filling the reader with confidence here! 

*So many bugs, so little dev time*
